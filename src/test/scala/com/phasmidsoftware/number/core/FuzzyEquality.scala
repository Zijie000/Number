  /**
    * An implicit equality implementation for instances of `NumberLike`.
    * Provides functionality to determine whether two instances are equal based
    * on their underlying types and properties.
    *
    * This object is used to enable tailored equality comparisons for `NumberLike` instances
    * according to their specific types, such as `Expression`, `Solution`, `Rational`, `Field`,
    * or `Number`.
    *
    * Equality checks are delegated to other equivalence implementations (`FieldEquality`
    * or `NumberEquality`) depending on the runtime type of the given `NumberLike` instance.
    *
    * Implementation Details:
    * - For an `Expression`, it uses the materialized form and delegates to `FieldEquality`.
    * - For a `Solution`, it converts to a `Field` and compares using `FieldEquality`.
    * - For a `Rational`, it converts to a `Number` and delegates to `NumberEquality`.
    * - For a `Field`, it directly delegates to `FieldEquality`.
    * - For a `Number`, it directly delegates to `NumberEquality`.

    * This equality implementation delegates its comparison to different equality strategies
    * depending on the specific type of the `Field` instance.
    *
    * - If the `Field` instance is of type `Algebraic`, the equality is determined by solving
    * the algebraic expression and delegating to `NumberLikeEquality`.
    * - If the `Field` instance is of type `Complex`, it checks if the other value is an instance
    * of `Numerical` and evaluates equality using the `Complex.isSame` method.
    * - If the `Field` instance is of type `Real`, it delegates the comparison to `NumberEquality`.
    *
    * This equality comparison ensures compatibility with mixed types while maintaining precise
    * behavior for the underlying mathematical constructs.

    * - When compared with an instance of `Algebraic`, the equality is determined by solving the algebraic representation and using the associated `NumberLikeEquality`.
    * - For all other cases, the comparison falls back to the `NumberEquality` logic.
